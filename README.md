In this repository you will find our Machine Learning Project's Jupyter
Notebook file. The Jupyter Notebook contains all the code necessary
for the project, there are no other additional files other than the
csv files for the datasets studied, though those can be obtained by 
downloading them through the links provided in the notebook near the
blocks of code that require it.
